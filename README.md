This here is my simple C++ algebra expression calculator made using **ONLY** the **stack** data structure.

I found that when most people build something like this they usually do it with a **tree**, just like my friend from whom I got the idea to make one myself.
As well as other similar programs that have some type of priority, because math has a thing called **PEMDAS**.
So I thought why not challenge myself, instead of using a tree data structure which makes things easier, why not do it using a stack?
Of course, this program is NO WAY memory efficient or fast but it gets the job done and I'm proud of what I built.

It's simple in a way since it cannot evaluate perhaps "advanced" expressions such as 3x = 15 and I will not implement such a feature 
because frankly I don't want to and I only made this as a challenge and for learning purposes. 

If you look into the code, you can see that I made my own stack data structure because I didn't know that C++ has already a built-in stack data structure and could have saved lots of time ðŸ˜€.
.....and I also left the code for the stack trace, and that will serve as the only documentation for this program aside from the comments ðŸ˜Œ

That is all and if anyone cares enough to test and find bugs, an issue ticket is appreciated ðŸ’š
